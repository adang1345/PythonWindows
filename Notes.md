## Python 3.5

- Build from a path that doesn't contain spaces. Otherwise you may get an error 9009 when executing `gendef`.
- If you get an error during documentation build saying that `itircl.dll` was not registered correctly, go to `externals\windows-installer\htmlhelp` and run `regsvr32 itcc.dll`. Or you can install [HTML Help Compiler](http://web.archive.org/web/20160201063255/http://download.microsoft.com/download/0/A/9/0A939EF6-E31C-430F-A3DF-DFAE7960D564/htmlhelp.exe) system-wide, which would register this DLL anyway.
- Install [Windows SDK 10.0.15063.468](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkId=845298), which is the latest version that is compatible with Tcl/Tk (https://core.tcl-lang.org/tk/tktview/9e31fd9449). It is OK to have a newer Windows SDK installed as well, in which case Windows SDK 10.0.15063.468 is used to build Tcl/Tk only while the newest installed Windows SDK is used for other components.
- Install Sphinx 1.7.9 for 3.5.5-3.5.7 or Sphinx 1.8.5 for 3.5.8-3.5.10 into a Python 3.6 venv and set `SPHINXBUILD` to the path to `sphinx-build.exe`.
- Apply `support-vs-2022-1.patch` to support building with Visual Studio 2022 using the v143 toolset and to avoid an issue where Tcl/Tk is not compatible with the Windows 11 SDK (derived from https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/0e4ad88ff8956d9289ab0a1314636ac15b374459, https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/eede148296bf3b4578b92ed6a07f2733a0f1c341, https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/c05e491a69df3fe0a8be91eeddd330792ada6755, https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/d9301703fb1086cafbd730c17e3d450a192485d6 and https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/45faf151c693b6f13f78926761caea6df7242024).
- Apply `get-dependencies-from-github.patch` to get external dependencies from GitHub instead of the old SVN repository at https://svn.python.org/projects/python/externals, which no longer exists (derived from https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/04431c926a88be433203f89e3577addd0d41b602). Dependencies are pulled from https://github.com/python/cpython-source-deps and https://github.com/python/cpython-bin-deps. However, some old versions of dependencies predate the migration to GitHub, so they are instead pulled from https://github.com/adang1345/cpython-source-deps and https://github.com/adang1345/cpython-bin-deps.
- Apply `build-full-installer-1.patch` to include debug symbols and debug binaries in the installer.
- Run `buildrelease.bat`.

- Install Sphinx 2.4.5 to a Python 3.6 venv and set `PYTHON` to the location of the Python executable.
- Apply `support-vs-2022-2.patch` to support building with Visual Studio 2022 using the v143 toolset and the Windows 11 SDK. Also avoid an issue where Tcl/Tk is not compatible with the Windows 11 SDK.
